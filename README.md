# Machine-Learning-Skoltech-Assignments
This repository includes the two assignments of ML course as a part of Master's Scholarship Program of [Data Science](https://www.skoltech.ru/en/education/msc-programs/ds/) at [Skoltech University](https://www.skoltech.ru/en)

Each notebook contains multiple problems that tackle several topics of Machine Learning, applying several approaches per problem in most cases.

## Assignment 1
This assignment includes practical problems about many topics such as:
- Feature Engineering
- Model Selection
- Bagging Ensembles, Boosting and Stacking
- Multiclass Classification

## Assignment 2
This assignment, divided into two notebooks, shows a wider range of topics, including:
- Bayesian ML
- Gaussian Processes
- Manifold Learning and Dimensionality Reduction
- Clustering
- Anomaly Detection
- Deep Neural Networks (Study of Activation Functions)
- Autoencoders
- Convolutional Neural Networks
